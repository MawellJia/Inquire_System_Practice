## Introduction
This is one of my assignments during my university education. This assignment aims for us to practice inquiry systems, comparison between TF-IDF and cosine similarity, and natural language processing. 
There are three questions for this assignment, and I have answered all the questions and got a high score. I want to appreciate my teacher's efforts here, I can't learn so many things without you, thank you. 
I uploaded this assignment mainly for my self-review so that I won't forget this knowledge. And it will be great if this assignment can help more people.

The three questions are mainly about:

Question 1 requires the implementation of a Boolean query system that supports AND, OR, NOT operators, and requires parsing Boolean queries and returning the correct document list.

Question 2 involves implementing a ranking information retrieval system that uses TF-IDF and cosine similarity to evaluate the similarity between documents and queries and returns the top N documents.

Question 3 requires the exploration and implementation of a language processing technique, such as lemmatization, stop word filtering or other text preprocessing techniques,
to improve the performance of information retrieval systems.
